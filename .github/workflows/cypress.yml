  test:
    name: Run Cypress
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use Ubuntu Linux runner for the tests

    steps:
      # Step 1: Get the source code from the repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment with version 20 and npm caching
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: npm

      # Step 3: Install project dependencies using npm ci (faster, more reliable than npm install)
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Install Cypress binary (includes Electron browser for headless testing)
      - name: Install Cypress
        run: npx cypress install

      # Step 5: Execute all Cypress test files in headless mode
      - name: Run Cypress tests
        run: npx cypress run

      # Step 6: Upload test results and reports as artifacts (runs even if tests fail)
      - name: Upload Cypress report
        if: always() # Upload report regardless of test results
